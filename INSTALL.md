# Building OneDrive Cloud Player

To build OneDrive Cloud Player, Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 with the UWP workload is required. Specifically, version 10.0.18362.0 and 10.0.19041.0 of the Windows 10 SDK are required.

Building should be as easy as cleaning the solution and going to Project -> Publish -> Create App Packages.

From there on, you can choose to deploy the built app packages locally, or sign them with your own certificate following [this guide](https://github.com/TimGels/OneDrive-Cloud-Player/wiki/Installing-the-self-signed-version-of-OneDrive-Cloud-Player).
